## Bindings in Other Languages

- [Python (via PyQt)](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) - Arguably the most comprehensive and well-known binding of Qt to another language.

...To be honest, that's the only one really worth mentioning as of this writing.  If you use a language that compiles to (or can easily and rapidly interface with) C++, I guess you could make something work.  If you're really so inclined, [these](http://www.ics.com/blog/using-qt-alternative-programming-languages-part-1) [two](http://www.ics.com/blog/using-qt-alternative-programming-languages-part-2) articles may pique your interest.

## Libraries

This section describes two kinds of third-party libraries; those that provide their own brand-new functionality (e.g. widgets), and those that provide integrations with existing software (e.g. scripting languages, clients for REST APIs).


### Integrations

- [QScintilla](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/qscintilla/intro) - An absurdly versatile and customizable text editor widget that provides syntax highlighting, code completion, code folding, recordable macros, and *much* more.  Created by the same company that developed PyQt.

### New Functionality

- V-Play
- Qtilities
- KDE libraries

## Software Repositories

If the [Libraries](#libraries) section doesn't satisfy you, perhaps one of these will.

- [#inqlude](https://inqlude.org) - The most well-known aggregation of Qt-centric libraries out there.  A package manager is also available [here](https://inqlude.org/get.html).
- [QtPods](http://www.qt-pods.org) - Another Qt-centric package manager.  If you want to see the offerings without using QtPods, the full list is available [here](https://github.com/qt-pods/qt-pods-master/blob/master/pods.json), and can be added to by submitting a pull request.
- [Linux-Apps.com](https://www.linux-apps.com) - Despite the name, Linux-Apps.com aggregates a wide variety of Qt-based tools and libraries for both end-users and developers.
- [Stephan Binner's Ubuntu PPAs](https://launchpad.net/~beineri) - Ubuntu users who are hesitant to install anything outside of their package managers can obtain any recent version of Qt from these repositories.  Instructions for adding them are found within.

## Software that Uses Qt

A framework is only as great as the software that uses it.  Fortunately, much great software uses Qt.

- [Autodesk Maya](http://www.autodesk.com/maya) - 3D animation and design software that has been used to create visual effects for some of the most popular movies and TV shows of all time.
- [CMake](https://cmake.org) - The closest thing to a standard C++ build system out there. The bundled GUI uses Qt.
- [CRYENGINE](https://www.cryengine.com) - But can it run Crysis?
- [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen) - The most popular documentation generator for C++, though it supports other languages as well.  The bundled GUI uses Qt.
- [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth) - *The* virtual globe.
- [KDE](https://www.kde.org) - A popular desktop environment for Linux.
- [Parallels Desktop](http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop) - Consumer-focused virtualization.
- [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/ide) - Something something eating your own dog food. Listed in the [official resources](#official-resources), but not listing it here doesn't feel right.
- [RUBE](https://www.iforce2d.net/rube) - A level design tool for any game that uses the Box2D physics engine.
- [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-linux) - Yes, *that* Skype.  Only the Linux version uses Qt.
- [TeamSpeak](http://www.teamspeak.com) - When gamers want to voice chat in a game that doesn't support it, they'll use this.
- [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org) - Perhaps the world's most popular tilemap editor.  Suitable for level design in games.
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) - Virtualization software for x86/64 processors.  The bundled GUI uses Qt.
- [Wolfram Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica) - Programming language, symbolic calculator, and engineer's best friend.
- [Yabause](https://yabause.org) - A Sega Saturn emulator.
